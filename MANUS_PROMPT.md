# Manus AI Deployment Prompt

This file contains the prompt to deploy the Autonomous Lead Generation System using Manus AI.

## The Prompt

```
I have a VPS with root access. I want to deploy the Autonomous Lead Generation System. Here are my details:

**VPS Details:**
*   IP Address: YOUR_VPS_IP
*   Username: root
*   Password: YOUR_VPS_PASSWORD

**API Keys:**
*   Apollo.io: YOUR_APOLLO_API_KEY
*   Instantly.ai: YOUR_INSTANTLY_API_KEY
*   Inframail API Key: YOUR_INFRAMAIL_API_KEY
*   Inframail Customer ID: YOUR_INFRAMAIL_CUSTOMER_ID
*   Inframail Profile ID: YOUR_INFRAMAIL_PROFILE_ID
*   Inframail Host Order ID: YOUR_INFRAMAIL_HOST_ORDER_ID

**Campaign & Domain:**
*   Instantly.ai Campaign ID: YOUR_CAMPAIGN_ID
*   Domains (from Inframail): ["yourdomain1.com", "yourdomain2.com"]
*   Dashboard Domain (optional): dashboard.yourdomain.com

Please connect to my VPS, download and install the Autonomous Lead Generation System, configure it with my API keys and settings, set up the dashboard with an SSL certificate, and start the system. The system should run continuously in the background.
```

## How to Use

1.  Replace all the placeholder values (e.g., `YOUR_VPS_IP`, `YOUR_APOLLO_API_KEY`) with your actual credentials and settings.
2.  Copy the entire prompt.
3.  Paste it into the Manus AI chat and send it.

The Manus AI agent will then take care of the entire deployment process for you.
